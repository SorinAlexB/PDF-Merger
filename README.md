# PDF-Merger
This project is a simple PDF file merger who operates from the command line. It is an alternative for the online PDF mergers so everyone can have a PDF merger that will not use any ad.
<br/>
<br/>
## Instalation
Firstly, for working with PDF files we need to install the PyPDF4 module. Simply run the next command for installation.
<br/>
```
pip install PyPDF4
```

<br/>
After this step you should only run the program from terminal. One example is displayed : 
<br/>

```
python3 PDF_Merger.py pdf1.pdf pdf2.pdf pdf3.pdf
```

<br/>
The output of the script will be a PDFs file named "merged-file.pdf" where all of your PDFs were merged.
